# MrMiner
Mr Miner is a GUI to help people get into mining in less than 5 minutes<br>

To get started download the zip file, unzip it and Cilck on the MrMiner exe.<br>

Once the application opens, select the currency that you want to mine and start making some $$$.<br>

We just started so we WILL have bugs! for bug reporting or general Sugestions please email us to aguy@misterminers . com <br>

we currently support mining for: Ethereum, Etereum Classic, Monero, Zcash and Sia. <br>

We connect you to mining pools which take a 1% comission and in Ethereum we also take a 1% comission. <br>
